    "\n",
    "PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, for those customers that are at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them to stay with our client. The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Associate Director (AD) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your team, you have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your AD wants an email with your thoughts on how the team should go about testing this hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client plans to use the predictive model on the 1st working day of every month to indicate to which customers the 20% discount should be offered.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hi [AD],\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the hypothesis of whether churn is driven by the customer's price sensitivity, we\n",
    "would need to model churn probabilities of customers, and derive the effect of prices on churn\n",
    "rates. We would need the following data to be able to build the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data needed:\n",
    "1. Customer data - which should include characteristics of each client, for example,\n",
    "industry, historical electricity consumption, date joined as customer etc.\n",
    "2. Churn data - which should indicate if customer has churned\n",
    "3. Historical price data – which should indicate the prices the client charges to each\n",
    "customer for both electricity and gas at granular time intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the data, the work plan would be:\n",
    "1. We would need to define what price sensitivity is and calculate it.\n",
    "2. We would need to engineer features based on the data that we obtain, and build a\n",
    "binary classification model (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted\n",
    "Machines to name a few),\n",
    "3. The best model would be picked based on the tradeoff between the complexity, the\n",
    "explainability, and the accuracy of the models.\n",
    "4. We would subsequently dive deeper into why and how price changes impact churn.\n",
    "5. Last but not least, the model would allow us to size the business impact of the client’s\n",
    "proposed discounting strategy.\n",
